# ToDos:

1. Allow usage of ES6 and TS for config files
2. Add progress bar in CLI
3. Add docusaurus support
4. Add memoization and caching mechanisms
5. Make templates functions instead of classes
6. Filter our declaration file of things out of lib context (out of public API)
7. Make command aliases easier to use and get rid of classes where possible
8. Try to simplify the big switch statement from index.ts
9. Get rid of as many index.ts as possible
10. Remove all instances of react-devcli from source code and only keep it for declaration file
