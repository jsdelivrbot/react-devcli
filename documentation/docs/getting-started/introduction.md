## The missing CLI tool for React developers

### Philosophy
The purpose of this library is to ease and boost development time
in React.js. Nowadays frameworks come with a huge ecosystem and bunch
of other related technologies, especially in the JavaScript world,
where skipping a month of technologies and trends moving around
might be a great miss.

Those being said, `react-devcli` is aiming to help developers do
everything right from the command line, having an easy to use
UNIX like interface. Starting from `boilerplate generation`, meaning
no need to copy paste files around, to `testing`, `linting`, `documenting`
and eventually `sharing` React components across the web

This allows the developers to focus on really building UI and not care so much
how to structure the application, copy and paste code around leaving dead
code from place to place or struggling to understand other
developer's code due to lack of documentation, or carrying the burden
of not being able to share your work without too much effort

### Credits
This tool is mainly inspired from how `Docker` CLI works and
it is organized. Also it has capabilities which `Angular` and `Vue`
CLIs provide and what's most importantly is as `UNIX` like
as possible, in order to make it easy to follow along with.
